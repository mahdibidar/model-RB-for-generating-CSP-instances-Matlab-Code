# model-RB-for-generating-CSP-instances-Matlab-Code
Model RB is a standard CSP generator which is commonly used by many researchers in this area to generate the CSP instances to test their new developed algorithms
# To generate a CSP, we need to run the CODE and select the number of variables, and also select a value in (0,1) to determine the hardness ofthe instance.
# The hardest instances (near to phase transition) are the problems with hardness=0.7
